Instructions for data input are found at the end of the input file		

The input is a free format, except that all input parameters must be entered
in the right order and preceded by an equal sign. Everything after a '%' is
ignored, similar to a Latex comment. Lines that start with a '*' will be
echoed in the output, and can be used to produce comments.

Keywords are case insensitive. Input file names should have proper case
because unix systems are case sensitive.
