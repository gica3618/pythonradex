1. download molpop-cep-master from github and compile the code to produce the molpop executable.
2. cp the file molpop.inp into molpop-cep-master. this file lists the models that should be calculated.
3. run molpop. it reads the file molpop.inp and calculates the models. output files (.out) will be placed in the same folder as the input files, i.e. molpopcep_models
