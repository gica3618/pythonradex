pythonradex solves the 1D non-LTE radiative transfer for a homogeneous medium. It is a tool to quickly estimate the radiation from an astrophysical gas. It also provides a convenient function to read data files from the LAMDA database. pythonradex is a python re-implementation of the RADEX code, with additional functionality not included in RADEX (treatment of overlapping lines, treatment of dust continuum, output of spectra,...)

For more details, please refer to the documentation: http://pythonradex.readthedocs.io/
