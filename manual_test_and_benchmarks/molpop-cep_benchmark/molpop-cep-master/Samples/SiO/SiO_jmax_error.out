* Sample Run for SiO
* Demostrates error in the application of the correction for
* finite number of rotation states
*
      Solution method is Slab (Capriotti) escape probability 

 *** When specifying Number of energy levels =  10
 *** max J in the ground vibration state cannot exceed  9
 *** Cannot specify jmax =  19

*** Terminated because of INPUT error ***
    Wrong option for jmax:  19
