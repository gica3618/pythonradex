1. download molpop-cep-master from github and compile the code to produce the molpop executable.
2. cp the file molpop.inp into molpop-cep-master. this file lists the models that should be calculated.
3.1 copy the files OH_H2o_modified.kij, OH_H2p_modified.kij and hcn@hfs_H2_lamda.kij to molpop-cep-master/DataBase/Coll
3.2 copy the files OH_modified.molecule and hcn@hfs_lamda.molecule to molpop-cep-master/DataBase
4. run molpop. it reads the file molpop.inp and calculates the models. output files (.out) will be placed in the same folder as the input files, i.e. molpopcep_models
