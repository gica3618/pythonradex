Instructions for Entering Input

1. The first line in this file must be of the form

      Gas Temperature = 50k,100k -1

   The code will then loop over the entered temperatures

2. Decide whether to have a PLOT file created. This file has the extension .plot
   and will contain output for the specific transitions selected at the
   end of the data input
                                                        
3. MOLECULAR species and number of energy levels                                                
  
      Molecule - current species are H2O_ortho, H2O_para, OH, SiO, CO
             
      Maximum number of energy levels
        ortho H2O    48
        para  H2O    48
        OH           32 (only 24 if using Offer collision rates)
        SiO         100 (J = 0--19 for v = 0--4) 
        CO          depends on choice of cross sections 
Depending on the temperature, you may wish to specify a smaller number than 
the maximum possible. There's no point in carrying levels with extremely small 
population. They only make the numerics difficult without adding any physical 
meaning

4. n_H2 - Molecular hydrogen density (molecules/cm-3) 
 
5. n_mol/n_H2 - Fractional abundance relative to H2

6. Decide whether to include the effects of line overlap.

7. Escape probability is either LVG or slab. 

For LVG, the velocity is the local expansion velocity in the Sobolev 
approximation and dlogV/dlogR its logarithmic derivative. The velocity must 
exceed the thermal speed in this case. The dimension R is the local radius .

For slab, the velocity is the microturbulent Doppler Width. The linewidth 
used in the calculations will be the larger of the entered Doppler Width or 
the thermal Doppler Width.  dlogV/dlogR is ignored in the slab model(but it
still must be entered). The dimension R is the slab thickness. Escape probability 
calculation is based on KROLIK AND MCKEE, AP. J. SUPP. 37, P459 (1978). The
calculated optical depth is now evaluated at line center.

8. Maser radiation affects level populations if Maser Saturation is included.

9. Maser filament aspect ratio must be >= 1. If it is one, then maser geometry 
is neglected. A value >1 corresponds to filamentary maser. Maser tau is 
multiplied by aspect and beaming angle is found from eq 3.26 Elitzur et 
al.,ApJ,367,333,1991.


10.  Collisional data - First entry is the number of collision partners.

Collision data for each collision partner contains five lines. All five must 
be specified, although some may be ignored.

      1st line contains a relative weight for the collision partner; will
          be translated to a fractional abundance relative to H2
      2nd line - one of the following options for the rate coefficients: 
          "table" 
          "semi-analytic" 
          "analytic"
      3rd line - one of the following data file names (ignored for "analytic"):
      "table"
              'H2Oo_H2.kij'  for ortho H2O -- H2
              'H2Op_H2.kij'  for para  H2O -- H2 
              'OH_H2o.kij'   for       OH  -- H2 ortho 
              'OH_H2p.kij'   for       OH  -- H2 para
          "semi-analytic"
              'SiO_H2.kij'   for "SiO_rovib"
              'CO_H2.kij'    for "CO_ab_initio"
      4th line contains calculation options as follows:
          for "table" the extrapolation law beyond tabulated temperatures 
              "sqrt(T)"  continuation from the table's extreme T
              "const" -- uses same rate as the table's extreme T
          for "semi-analytic" currently available options are
              "SiO_rovib"       for SiO--H2 (used with 'SiO_H2.kij';
                                    Bieniek & Green 1983, ApJ 265, L29)
              "CO_ab_initio"    for CO--H2  (used with 'CO_H2.kij';
                                    McKee et al 1982, ApJ 259, 647)  
          for "analytic" currently available options are
              "hard_sphere"     for any molecule
              "surprisal"       for OH--H2 and CO--H2 (Procaccia & Levine  
                                    1975, J. Chem. Phys., 63, 4261)
              "close_coupling"  for CO--H2 (analytic formula by de Jong, Chu 
                                    & Dalgarno 1975, ApJ 199, 69)
      5th line specifies an optional scaling factor from nominal x-section; in
               effect only for "hard_sphere" and "surprisal"; ignored otherwise

EXAMPLE - following uses OH Offer collisions with H2 where ortho:para = 3:1
 
      Number of collision partners = 2
      
                        weight = 3
        collision rates option = table
                     data file = OH_H2o.kij
            calculation option = sqrt(T)
                scaling factor = 1.0

                        weight = 1
        collision rates option = table
                     data file = OH_H2p.kij
            calculation option = sqrt(T)
                scaling factor = 1.0



11. External Radiation: The 3K cosmic background is always included. Optionally, 
    other components can be added

  A.  Additional diluted blackbody fields. Each field is defined through its 
      coefficient W and temperature T_bb. The list ends when W = 0. If the very 
      first entry has W = 0, nothing is added.  Example, a 500 K black body
      diluted to 1% of the Planck function:

             W = 0.01; T_bb = 500 K
             W = 0   ; T_bb = 500 K

  B. Radiation by single-temperature dust calculated according to eq. 1 of 
     Lockett et al., 1999, ApJ, 511, 235. Enter the visual dust optical depth 
     and its temperature. Enter as many components as you wish and end the 
     list with tau = 0. Example, 100 K dust with tau(V) = 1:

             Dust tau at visual = 1.0  temperature   = 100 K
             Dust tau at visual = 0.   temperature   = 100 K


   C. Radiation from a DUSTY output file. Enter the name of the file containing 
      the desired SED. This spectral shape will be scaled to the bolometric flux
      of the input luminosity at the input distance. Example:

          Radiation from DUSTY file = Sample.stb
             Luminosity = 1.E4 Lo  
             distance from source = 1.E15 cm

      You bypass this option with:

          Radiation from DUSTY file = none
             Luminosity = 1.E4 Lo  
             Distance from source = 1.E15 cm

On a UNIX system, make sure 'none' is entered in lower case. Luminosity and 
distance must be entered even though they are meaningless in this case

NUMERICS

Solution strategy -- choose one and comment out the other as in the example 
below: 
  "increasing" -- start from optically thin solution for zero tau
     by solving the linear rate equations. Then find R such that all
     optical depths are smaller than the input tau_m. Solve for that based
     on the linear solution. Increase R until it exceeds the input R_m or the
     column exceeds the input N_col, whichever comes first
  "decreasing" -- start from thermal equilibrium level populations.
     Then find R such that all optical depths are larger 
     than the input tau_m. Solve for that based on the thermal populations. 
     Decrease R until it is smaller then the input R_m or the column is 
     less then the input N_col, whichever comes first.

Example:
    Solution strategy = increasing
       start with all optical depths less than tau_m = 1
       stop when dimension exceeds R_m   = 1.E15 cm
       or H2 column exceeds        N_col = 1.E23 cm^-2
             
%    Solution strategy = decreasing
%       start with all optical depths more than tau_m = 1.e3
%       stop when dimension less than R_m = 1.E15 cm
%       or H2 column less then      N_col = 1.E20 cm^-2
     
The following entries control the numerics. To achieve solution, the code may 
take small steps in increasing R and you place a limit on how small they can 
become through the maximum number of (logarithmic) dimension steps allowed per 
decade. Just to be sure the code does not disappear into an infinite loop, you 
also specify a limit on the global number of R steps allowed. Irrespective of 
the number of R steps, the number of outputs the code will produce per decade 
is what you specify in the input. Then enter the accuracy demanded in the 
solution of the non-linear level population equations. Finally enter the total
number of iterations allowed in the Newton solution of the level equations.

Example:     
    Number of printings per decade                       = 5
    Maximum number of dimension steps allowed per decade = 20
    Total number of steps allowed to reach any limit     = 200
    Accuracy in NEWTON subroutine                        = 1.0e-4
    Maximum number of iterations in Newton               = 50

PRINT CONTROL PARAMETERS

You control output by turning printing switches on and off. First, you can 
produce a printing of the level properties and the transitions. There are two 
master switches, one for the level the other for the transitions. Turning 
either of them on, you control their effect by selecting the info you want 
out. The following example will produce a listing of wavelength and collision 
rate for all the transitions and then will stop without solving anything, so 
you can keep a separate file of this molecular data:

      Printing of molecular data (on or off):

      Print energy level data      = off
        statistical weights g_i    = on
        energy in cm^{-1}          = on
        energy in GHz              = on
        energy in K                = on
        quantum numbers            = on
      Print transition data        = off
        wavelength in micron       = on
        energy in GHz              = off
        energy in K                = off
        Einstein coefficients A_ij = off
        collision rates C_ij       = on
      Stop after printing molecular data = off


Next you control the amount of output the program produces during the run. In 
the following example, all messages and preliminaries are off: 

      Messages from NEWTON (off or on) = off
      Messages from step-size selector (off or on) = off
      Printing output for initial guess (off or on) = off

If you wish detailed output as the run progresses turn the following flag on: 

      information on each step (off or on)= on

This will produce output on every printing step. In that case you can select 
among the output components with the next two input entries. To get level 
populations turn on the next flag:
      
      print detailed populations (off or on) = on

You can output the top thermal emitting lines during each printing step by 
entering a number other than 0 in the following (note, there are no more then 
NxN transitions among N levels!):

      Number of cooling lines to print = 15

In addition, the code will output information on all inverted lines, if any 
exist. This output will include the optical depth, excitation temperature and 
inversion efficiency. 

Finally, you can select some specific transitions for special output that will 
be listed at the end of the run in summary form. These are also the transitions 
that will be sent to the PLOT file. Enter a number different from 0 (up to 10) 
for the number of transitions and then enter a pair of level identifier numbers 
for each transition.  The following example selects a summary output for a 
couple of transitions, which happen to be strong masers when the run is for 
ortho H2O (15-14 is the 22GHz line in that case):

       Number of transitions for summary and plot= 2 
      
       i =  8      j =  7    
       i = 15      j = 14

The listing will be different at the R's where the transition is inverted and 
where it is thermal.
