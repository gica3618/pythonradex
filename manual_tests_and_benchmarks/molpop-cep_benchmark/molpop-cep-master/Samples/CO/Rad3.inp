Instructions for data input are found at the end of the input file		

The input is a free format, except that all input parameters must be entered
in the right order and preceded by an equal sign. Everything after a '%' is
ignored, similar to a Latex comment. Lines that start with a '*' will be
echoed in the output, and can be used to produce comments.

Keywords are case insensitive. Input file names should have proper case
because unix systems are case sensitive.

__________________

Solution method for radiative transfer: Choice of an exact CEP calculation
or one of three variants of the escape probability method --- slab using the
Capriotti escape probability, or LVG in the spherical or plane-parallel
geometry. The logarithmic velocity gradient (= 1 for Hubble flow, v propto
r) takes effect only for LVG calculations  

__________________
                                   
Specify the name of the directory with molecular data files and enter the
name of the molecular species and number of energy levels
                                                 
Depending on the temperature, a smaller number than the maximum possible may
be better. There's no point in carrying levels with extremely small
populations. They only make the numerics difficult, and may even preclude
solution, without adding any physical meaning.

In the case of a vib-rot configuration, vib_max is the highest v-number
included. When vib_max > 0, enter also the maximum rotation number j_max for
the ground vibration state and the molecular rotation constant in degrees K.
MOLPOP will then correct for the finite number of ground state rotational
levels with the method of Lockett & Elitzur 1992, ApJ, 399, 704. 

EXAMPLE --- SiO with 5 vibration states and 20 rotational levels in the 
v = 0 state:

      vib_max = 4   jmax = 19  rot_const = 1.04 K

Collisional data - First entry is the number of collision partners.

For each collision partner, entry data contain three lines: 

      1st line - the relative weight for the collision partner; will be 
                 translated to a fractional abundance relative to ntot
                 In the case of CEP calculations with variable conditions, 
                 this entry is the column number in the data file (see next) 
                 containing the tabulation of relative weights for the 
                 collision partner
      2nd line - the name of the data file in subdirectory 'Coll' of the 
                 database directory with the tabulated collision rates
      3rd line - the extrapolation law used beyond tabulated temperatures 
                     "sqrt(T)" -- continuation from the table's extreme T
                     "const"   -- uses same rate as the table's extreme T
                 Note: all interpolations between table extremes are linear

EXAMPLE - collisions of CO with H2 where ortho:para = 3:1 
          when the physical conditions are uniform

    Number of collision partners = 2

         weight / column for CEP = 3
                       data file = Yang_CO_H2o.kij
            extrapolation option = sqrt(T)

         weight / column for CEP = 1
                       data file = Yang_CO_H2p.kij
            extrapolation option = sqrt(T)

__________________

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS

For CEP calculations with variable physical conditions, enter the name of
the data file containing the tabulations of the density and temperature
profiles. 

For uniform physical conditions, mandatory for escape probability and
optional for CEP, the file name is 'none' and the following two entries are
the gas temperature and overall density (in cm-3).  These two entries must
be commented out with '%', or even removed, in the case of variable
conditions.

__________________

SOME SPECIAL EXTENSIONS OF RADIATIVE TRANSFER are available only in the case
of escape probability calculations:

1. Effect of dust absorption on line transfer. 1st entry is the name of the
file tabulating the dust absorption coefficient normalized to unity at
visual vs wavelength in microns. The MOLPOP database contains a tabulation
for standard Galactic dust in 'Standard_ISM.dat'.

Next entry is the dust abundance relative to standard ISM. An entry of 0
implies no dust absorption effects. For an entry of 1, the dust optical
depth at visual is 1.00E-21 times the column (in cm^-2) of H nuclei. The
next two entries are the molecular abundance relative to total density and
the line width in kms. When the dust abundance is 0, these entries are
irrelevant.

2. Including effects of line overlap is selected with an on/off switch. When
'ON', overlap effects are handled with the method of Lockett and Elitzur
1989, ApJ 344, 525, using the linewidth entered before.

NOTE: line overlap cannot be used together with dust absorption

3. Maser radiation effect on level populations is included when this option
is 'ON'

_____________________

EXTERNAL RADIATION: 
The 3K cosmic background is always included. Optionally, other components
can be added as follows:

1.  Additional diluted blackbody fields. Each field is defined through its
dilution factor W and temperature T_bb. Also need to specify whether the
radiation is internal to the source or coming from left, right or both
sides; this option takes effect only in the case of CEP calculations. The
list ends when W = 0. If the very first entry has W = 0, nothing is added.  

Example -- a 500 K black body diluted to 1% of the Planck function:

      W = 0.01 
      T_bb = 500 K
      Illumination from (left/right/both/internal) = left
      W = 0

2. Radiation by single-temperature dust calculated according to eq. 1 of
Lockett et al., 1999, ApJ, 511, 235. Enter the visual dust optical depth and
its temperature, followed by the directional information (relevant only for
CEP). The list ends when tau = 0. If the very first entry has tau = 0,
nothing is added.  

Example -- 100 K dust with tau(V) = 3:

      Dust tau at visual = 3.
      Dust temperature = 100 K
      Illumination from (left/right/both/internal) = internal
      Dust tau at visual = 0.

3. Radiation SED from a file. Enter the name of the file containing
tabulation of the desired SED as lambda*Flambda (= nu*Fnu) vs lambda in
microns, listed in its first two columns; the tabulation may contain
additional columns, which will be ignored. The MOLPOP Samples directory
contains two SED sample files: the interstellar radiation field in
'ISRF.dat' and a sample output of the DUSTY code in 'SampleDUSTY.stb'. This
spectral shape will be scaled to the bolometric energy density, which can by
specified as either Jbol in W/m^2 or as a distance from a source of given
luminosity. 

EXAMPLES:
A. Illumination by a source 1.E15 cm away with luminosity 1.E4 Lo, whose SED
is specified in the supplied SampleDUSTY.stb:

      Radiation from file = Samples/SampleDUSTY.stb
             Entry for the bolometric scale (ENERGY_DEN/L&R) = L&R
%             Jbol = 3.E-6 W/m^2
             Luminosity = 1.E4 Lo          Distance from source = 1.E15 cm
             Illumination from (left/right/both/internal) = left

B. Internal radiation with the ISRF spectral shape and energy density 
3.E-6 W/m^2:

     Radiation from file = Samples/ISRF.dat
             Entry for the bolometric scale (ENERGY_DEN/L&R) = Energy_den
             Jbol = 3.E-6 W/m^2
             %Luminosity = 1.E4 Lo          Distance from source = 1.E15 cm
             Illumination from (left/right/both/internal) = internal

To bypass this option:

     Radiation from file = none
%             Type of entry for the bolometric scale (ENERGY_DEN/L&R) = L&R
%             Luminosity = 1.E4 Lo  
%             Distance from source = 1.E15 cm
%             Illumination from (left/right/both/internal) = internal

NUMERICS

Solution strategy -- choose one of the following: 

"increasing" 
The code starts from an optically thin solution for zero tau by solving the
linear rate equations. Then it finds molecular column Nmol such that all
optical depths are smaller than the input tau_m and solves for that based on
the linear solution. Then Nmol is increased until it exceeds the input
Nmol_m.

"decreasing" 
The code starts from thermal equilibrium level populations. Then it finds
molecular column Nmol such that all optical depths are larger than the input
tau_m and solves for that based on the thermal populations. Then Nmol is
decreased until it exceeds the input Nmol_m.
    
Subsequent entries control the numerics. To achieve solution, the code may
take small steps in increasing Nmol and a limit is placed on how small they
can become through the maximum number of (logarithmic) dimension steps
allowed per  decade. To ensure that the code not disappear into an infinite
loop, a limit is specified for the global number of Nmol steps allowed.
Irrespective of the number of Nmol steps, the number of outputs the code
will produce per decade is as specified in the input. The entered accuracy
controls the solution of the non-linear level population equations; a
solution is attained once the relative change in any level population
between successive iterations is below the prescribed accuracy. That
accuracy must be achieved within the prescribed total number of iterations. 
_____________________

NUMERICS CONTROLS RELEVANT ONLY FOR CEP

These include (1) A choice between the Newton method and an accelerated
Lambda-iteration for solving the equations. The latter may be preferable
when the number of equations (= number of levels times number of zones)
exceeds ~ 1,000. (2) Precision in convergence to the exact solution. MOLPOP
will keep refining the grid until the relative variation of all variables is
less than prescribed for successive refinements. (3) The initial number of
grid zones. Input from a file with variable physical conditions will
override this entry. (4) The angle for output intensity. Normal to the slab
face is mu = 1.
   
_____________________

PRINT CONTROL PARAMETERS

The amount of output is controlled by turning printing switches on and off.
First, you can produce a printing of the properties of the level and the
transitions. There are two master switches, one for the levels the other for
the transitions. Turning either of them on, their effect is controlled by
selecting the desired info in subsequent switches. After printing all the
desired information, optionally the program can be stopped without solving
anything so that this molecular data can be kept in a separate file. 

Next, the amount of output the program produces during the run is controlled
with similar switches. For detailed output as the run progresses, turn the
following flag on: 

      information on each step = on

This will produce output on every printing step. The output will include the
top thermal emitting lines that contribute at least 1% to the overall
cooling rate by the molecule . In addition, it will output information on
all inverted lines, if any exist. This output will include the optical
depth, excitation temperature and inversion efficiency. 

Every output ends with a summary. Some specific transitions can be selected
for special output in that end-of-the-run summary. Entering 0 will produce
no lines while -1 will output information on all allowed transitions.
Selecting a number > 0 for the number of transitions is followed by a pair
of level identifier numbers for each transition.  The following example
selects a summary output for a couple of strong maser transitions of ortho
H2O (15-14 is the 22GHz line in that case):

       Number of transitions for detailed output = 2 
      
       i =  8      j =  7    
       i = 15      j = 14

The listing will be different at the molecular columns where the transition
is inverted and where it is thermal.
