Instructions for data input are found at the end of the input file		

The input is a free format, except that all input parameters must be entered
in the right order and preceded by an equal sign. Everything after a '%' is
ignored, similar to a Latex comment. Lines that start with a '*' will be
echoed in the output, and can be used to produce comments.

Keywords are case insensitive. Input file names should have proper case
because unix systems are case sensitive.

      When any of these transitions is inverted, list its
         maser pump parameters (off or on) = on
         (this option is ignored in CEP calculations)
         The transitions are:
