This file contains the MOLPOP molecular list. A molecule whose mol_name is,
e.g., XYZ should have a data file XYZ.lev with listing of N_lev energy levels
and XYZ.aij tabulating their A-coefficients. mol_mass is the mass number. 
When adding another molecule make sure to terminate  data lines with CR.
