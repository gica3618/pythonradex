 *** Parameters for selected transitions
     Flux (in W/m2) is integrated over the line
     Io is the source line-center intensity at mu =  1.00 to slab face
     del(Tb) is obtained from (B is the Planck function):
                B(del(Tb)) = I(observed) - B(Tcmb)
     del(TRJ) is obtained from the same with the RJ approximation for B
     Excitation temperature is not part of the output in CEP
                because it changes with position in the slab. The excitation temperature
                will be placed in the file with extension CEP.texc for all column densities
